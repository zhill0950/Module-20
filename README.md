# Module 20 - CI/CD: GitHub Actions

## Description

For this challenge, I was tasked with creating a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to run the component tests via Cypress when a Pull Request is made to the develop branch. The application must also deploy when the code is merged from develop to the main branch.

## User Story

```md
AS A developer looking to integrate a pipeline in a codebase for continuous integration and deployment,
I WANT to create a GitHub Action that will follow best practices by running test cases when a Pull Request is made to the develop branch
SO THAT I can ensure that all code integrations are clean and pass the proper requirements.

AS A developer looking to deploy the application automatically to Render when code is merged from develop to main,
I WANT to create a GitHub Action that will run when the code is merged to main and automatically deploys to Render
SO THAT the application is constantly updated when major releases are made to the main branch.
